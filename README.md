# reactor-uc

`reactor-uc` is a task scheduling runtime implementing the reactor
model-of-computation target at embedded and resource-constrained systems.

## Getting started

NB: reactor-uc is still work-in-progress and sevearal reactor features are not supported
yet. Moreover, the runtime has not been thoroughly tested so if you find any bugs or issues, please report them.

Setup the environment

```shell
source env.bash
```

Initialize submodules

```shell
git submodule update --init
```

Compile and run unit tests:

```shell
make test
```

## Examples

### Linux/POSIX

```shell
make examples
build/examples/posix/timer_ex
```

### Zephyr
Compile and run a simple test on Zephyr. This requires a correctly configured
Zehyr environment, with West installed in a Python virtual environment which is
activated. Inspect `.github/actions/zephyr/action.yml` for an example of how to setup your Zephyr workspace. 

First a simple HelloWorld on the qemu_cortex_m3 target:
```shell
cd examples/zephyr/hello
west build -b qemu_cortex_m3 -p always -t run
```

Then a simple blinky targeting NXP FRDM K64F. This will run with most boards supporting Zephyr that has a user LED.
```shell
cd examples/zephyr/blinky
west build -b frdm_k64f -p always
west flash
```
For more information on running LF programs using the reactor-uc runtime on
Zephyr take a look at this template: <https://github.com/lf-lang/lf-west-template/tree/reactor-uc>

### RIOT
Compile and run a simple blinky example on RIOT.
This requires a correctly configured RIOT environment.
Make sure that the environment variable `RIOTBASE` points to a `RIOT` codebase.

```shell
cd examples/riot/blinky
make BOARD=native all term
```

### Pico
Download `pico-sdk` and define PICO_SDK_PATH as an environmental variable.

```shell
cd examples/pico
cmake -Bbuild
cd build
make
```

### Lingua Franca
NB: We are currently not keeping `lfc` up-to-date. We will probably do so again when the APIs have stabilized.

We have copied a very limited version of the Lingua Franca Compiler (lfc) into
`~/lfc` of this repo. In the future, the `reactor-uc` specific code-generation
will be merged back upstream. By sourcing `env.bash` or `env.fish` the Lingua
Franca Compiler will be aliased by `lfcg` for Lingua Franca Generator since this
limited version mainly oes does code-generat

```shell
cd examples/lf
lfcg src/HelloUc.lf
```

Since a target platform is not specified, we will target POSIX in which case
`lfc` will generate a main function and invoke CMake directly on the generated
sources. Run the program with:

```shell
bin/HelloUc
```

## Goals

- Incorporate unit testing and test-driven development from the start
- Optimized for single-core 32-bit systems
- Backend for LF
- Standalone library
- Use clang-format and clang-tidy to write safe code from the start.
- CMake-based
- Optimized for single-threaded runtime, but support for federated execution
which enable distributed embedded systems.
- Avoid malloc as much as possible (or entirely?)

## References

`reactor-uc` draws inspiration from the following existing open-source projects:

- [reactor-cpp](https://github.com/lf-lang/reactor-cpp)
- [reactor-c](https://github.com/lf-lang/reactor-c)
- [qpc](https://github.com/QuantumLeaps/qpc)
- [ssm-runtime](https://github.com/QuantumLeaps/qpc)

## Troubleshooting

### Formatting

We are using `clang-format` version 18.1.3 which is default with Ubuntu 24.04 for formatting in CI.

### LFC

If you get the following CMake error when calling `lfc/bin/lfc-dev`

```
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:7 (message):
  Environment variable REACTOR_UC_PATH is not set.  Please source the
  env.bash in reactor-uc.
```

Please source `env.bash` or `env.fish`.
