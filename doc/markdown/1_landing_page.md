\warning reactor-uc is currently being developed! This documentation and reactor-uc functionality is subject to change!

`reactor-uc` (pronounced reactor micro-c) is a distributed task scheduling runtime for [Lingua Franca](https://lf-lang.org)
targeted at embedded and resource-constrained systems.

## Supported Platforms

`reactor-uc` can run on top of Zephyr, RIOT, the Raspberry Pi Pico, as well as POSIX-compliant operating systems.

## Contributing

We are using `clang-format` version 18.1.3 which is default with Ubuntu 24.04 for formatting in CI. For kotlin we use `ktfmt` from facebook, both formatters can be called via `make format`.
