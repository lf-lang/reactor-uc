Learning a new framework and worse a framework for system-design and synthesis is an intimidating process. This guide explains the core concepts of reactor-uc and is highly recommended for beginners.

\note If you are not familiar with Lingua Franca (LF), please refer to the [manual](https://www.lf-lang.org/docs/).

## Building

The design of systems with reactor-uc and Lingua Franca follows a top-down design approach, where the programmer starts with his design written in Lingua Franca. The LF code generator (LFG) translates your design into C code. This generated code uses the reactor-uc runtime functions to execute the program. When you create federated (distributed) programs, the LFG generates subfolders for each federate (node) in your system. We understand that we will never be able to provide an "apple-like" experience for every platform, so the code-generator also generates importable CMake and make files that you can import into your build-system. For common platforms like [Zephyr](https://zephyrproject.org/), [RIOT](https://riot-os.org) or the [pico-sdk](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/pico-sdk/) we provide build-templates. 

## Federation Design
We call the network abstraction in reactor-uc `NetworkChannels`, which are bidirectional message pipes between two federates. Depending on which platform you are working on, reactor-uc supports different NetworkChannels, such as: `TcpIpChannel`, `UARTChannel` or `CoapUdpChannel`. You can find a complete table with all network channels that are supported on the individual platforms [here](TODO).

```lf
federated reactor {
  @interface_tcp(name="if1", address="127.0.0.1")
  src = new Src()

  @interface_tcp(name="if1", address="127.0.0.1")
  dst = new Dst()

  @link(left="if1", right="if1", server_side="right", server_port=1042)
  src.out -> dst.in
}
```
