 * If a neighbor has not reached the state, the retry function will be called. Before checking the condition
 * again a wait time will be calculated based on the expected_connect_duration of the channels.
 * Used for establishing connection to neighbors, for performing a handshake and for negotiating the start tag.
 *
 * @param self
 * @param condition_locked A function that takes the coordinator and the index of the neighbor and returns true if the
 * neighbor has reached the state. Called from a critical section.
 * @param retry_locked A function that takes the coordinator and the index of the neighbor and retries the action.
